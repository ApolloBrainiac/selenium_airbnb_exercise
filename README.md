# selenium_airbnb_exercise
Exercise for Selenium Webdriver Course

## Details
This is a simple Selenium test written using Python3.

### Project Instructions
The automation code should produce the following steps:
	1. Open airbnb.com
	2. Enter where you want to visit
	3. Enter check-in and check-out dates
	4. Select the number of guests from dropdown

### Further Notes
The exercise was written for a prior version of the AirBNB website. As such, while it was originally intended for students to use the Select class from Selenium, the updated site rendered the class unnecessary.
