# selenium_airbnb_exercise
Exercise for Selenium Webdriver Course

## Details
This is a simple Selenium test written using Python3.

### Project Instructions
The automation code should produce the following steps:
	1. Open airbnb.com
	2. Enter where you want to visit
	3. Enter check-in and check-out dates
	4. Select the number of guests from dropdown
	5. Click on Search button

### Further Notes
The exercise was written for a prior version of the AirBNB website. As such, while it was originally intended for students to use the Select class from Selenium, the updated site rendered the class unnecessary.

Many of the solutions I came up with to address this discrepancy are a little quick and dirty. I plan to revisit this test and re-factor after gaining a better understanding of Selenium with Python.
